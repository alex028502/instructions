# Instructions

I had two sets of instructions I wanted to write down for later, and figured it
might be just as easy to do it somewhere public, in case somebody else could use
them too, and to make it easier to find them when I need them.

It turned out it wasn't "just as easy", but that's OK.

[these instructions](./gdb-arduino-sketch) are for using gdb with the arduino
platform and STM32.

[these instructions](./push-notification) are for sending yourself a test push
notification (to see how they work) with just `curl`.
