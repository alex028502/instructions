# Instructions

I created this repo because I needed somewhere to put
[these instructions](./gdb-arduino-sketch) for using gdb with the arduino
platform with and STM32. They are mainly for me in the future but if they help
anybody else, that's great too.

I structured the repo this way just in case I ever have another set of notes
I want to commit to memory.
